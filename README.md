# first_flutter_app

A new Flutter project.

## Starting my Flutter Journey

CodeLabs -> https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0

Started with the 'Your first Flutter App' of the Google CodeLabs example.

Worked it through and I am currently getting slowley an idea of it's capabilities / potential.

Each journey begins with a step and this was mine, now I'm looking forward to learn more about Flutter and Dart.

## Further Adjusting the Example

After finishing the CodeLabs example, I looked up the example on DartPad and adjusted my code to their example.
